본 포스트는 테스트용 입니다.

1. 모든 데이터를 최대한 끌어모은다.
2. 모은 데이터를 기반으로 obsidian 으로 정리한다.
3. obsidian 은 폴더 기반, markdown 과 잘맞기 때문에 스크립트 작성으로 자동화한다.
3. 적힌 글을 ruby 기반 jekyll framework 를 써서 deploy 한다.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild he site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
